# PyCoding Helper for [Geany](https://geany.org) which needs [Peasy](https://github.com/kugel-/peasy)


#### Comes with:

 * Auto Lint Python Files based on [this helper](https://wiki.geany.org/howtos/check_python_code). Runs automatically on open/activation of python files if configured.
 * Format python code option with auto run on save which can be configured. Can use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or `autopep8` or `yapf`.
 * Complete Python Code Based on [jedi](https://jedi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
 * Opinionated python project initializer for geany based on `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`
